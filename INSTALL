If you read that, then you have already downloaded and unpacked the source
archive. Process with these steps:

1. Make sure you have a working build environment: C compiler and perl 5
   interpreter.

2. Edit the Makefile to set up the build options. This include compiler and
   linker options, and the target directories. Note that for BSD systems,
   you must add -lutil to LIBS.

3. Type "make".

4. Test the result with "TERMIMRC=termimrc ./termim" (or anything similar
   that works with your particular shell) in an UTF-8 terminal.

5. Type "make install", or copy yourself the binary, the man page and the
   default config file.
