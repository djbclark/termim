This input method allows one to type Hangul syllables (or elements) using
a standard Korean keyboard layout.

Note that your keyboard must be, if not a Korean keyboard, at least
configured to use a QWERTY layout; otherwise some keys will be misplaced. 

Unless you are Korean and/or familiar to the layout of Korean keyboards, 
this is probably not the best input method for you: try the "korean" input
method (based on transliteration) instead.

The composition process requires a lookahead of a syllable; the Hangul
elements retained in the buffer are displayed on the status line at the
bottom of the screen. 

The backspace key (or control-H) removes a character from the lookahead
buffer if it is not empty, else it is passed on to the application.
Control-C, control-D and control-G empty the lookahead buffer if it is not
empty, else they are passed on to the application.

If a syntax error occurs in the input (a vowel without an initial consonant,
or too many consecutive consonants), the elements that cannot fit into a
syllable are output directly (uncombined).

Composed final consonants and composed vowels are formed by typing the two
elements consecutively.

Special key: [Z] (capital Z) protects the following key, which is handled
as is without any processing.
