This input methods allows one to input Japanese text - both kana and kanji.
This is done using latin transliterations; this method is _not_ suitable
for use with a Japanese keyboard.

  KANA INPUT

This IM accepts both the Hepburn and Kunrei systems of transliteration, 
as far as this is possible without causing ambiguity. (A complete list of
accepted transliterations is available at the end of this document.)
Hiragana are input in lowercase and katakana in uppercase (actually, the
relevant factor is the case of the first letter in the transliteration of
the current character).

Roman letters which have not yet been used to form a character are displayed
on the termim status line. If this buffer is not empty, you can use the
Backspace (or Control-H) key to remove one letter from it; when the buffer is
empty, the backspace character is passed on to the application.  Likewise, the
Control-C and Control-D keys cause the buffer to be emptied if it is not,
and are passed on to the application if it is. The Escape key causes the
buffer to be emptied, but is also passed on to the application in all cases
(this is necessary in order not to break up terminal control sequences.)

In addition, when the buffer is empty, a few keys are used to input Japanese
punctuation - again, a list is available at the end of this document. The
input method also uses the backquote (`) and tilde (~) characters to switch
to kanji input; anything else is passed on to the application.


  KANJI INPUT

The backquote (`) key is used to look up a word in the IM's dictionary.
When you press the backquote key, the backquote sign appears on the left
on the termim status line, and any text you subsequently enter is not
passed on to the application, but instead displayed on the status line.

The text on the status line can be followed by:
 - suspension marks (...): this means that the current text does not
   correspond to any dictionary entry, but is a prefix of one or more
   entries.
   e.g. `hira yields `ひら... on the status line
 - (***): this means there are no dictionary entries starting with the
   current text - so either you've made a spelling mistake or you're
   trying to input a word termim doesn't know of, in which case see
   "Direct kanji selection" below.
   e.g. `aaa yields `あああ (***) on the status line
 - A word in kanji, along with an index number
   e.g `kanji yields `かんじ (1/9:感じ)
   This means that 感じ is the first of nine words spelt かんじ in the
   dictionary. You can then use the < and > keys to scroll through the
   available words.

When a matching word has been found, the Space and Return keys cause the
corresponding word to be sent to the application. When no word from the
dictionary match the current content of the buffer, the contents of the
buffer are sent as hiragana. The Tab key causes the contents of the buffer
to be sent as hiragana, regardless of whether a matching word has been
found. The Backspace key works as you'd expect, deleting first latin 
characters that have not been used to form kana yet, then kanas, and
aborting the lookup if the buffer was empty. The Escape, Control-C and
Control-D keys abort the lookup, losing the contents of the buffer; the
Escape character is also passed on to the application. 

Note that the dictionary does not include any support for grammatical
inflections - you need to input the dictionary form and then correct it
manually.

  KANJI SELECTION

Kanji selection allows you to select a kanji to be sent to the application
by radical and stroke-count; this is useful if you want to enter a word that
doesn't appear in the dictionary. (there is currently no way of adding a
word to the dictionary short of recompiling termim). It is accessed by
pressing the ~ key from the main mode. When in kanji selection mode, the
status line looks like the following:

R85(水) S+4 (2/5):1.汶 2.汸 3.汹 4.決 5.汻 6.汽 7.汾 8.沁 9.沂 0.沃

This means you're currently viewing kanji classified under radical 85
(water), with 4 extra strokes, and these are kanji 11-20 out of 41
to 50 available (i.e. screen 2/5). The [ and ] keys will scroll through
the radicals; the { and } keys do the same but by increments of 10. 
The + (or =) and - (or _) keys increase and decrease the additional
stroke count; the < and > keys let you scroll through the kanji available
for the currently selected radical and stroke count. 0-9 cause the 
corresponding kanji to be sent to the application; Return is synonymous
with 1 if there's only one kanji available.

As usual, Escape, Control-C and Control-D abort to the default input mode,
with Escape also being passed on to the application.

Note that kanji selection uses the traditional radicals (from the Unihan
database) and NOT e.g. the simplified Nelson radicals; for instance, be
wary of the distinction between radical 74 (月) and the variant form of
radical 130 (肉).

The small 'tsu' kana (っ) is obtained by doubling the following
consonant (unless it's an n or an m, in which case doubling yields
a ん instead). For っち, both the cchi and tchi transliterations are
supported.
