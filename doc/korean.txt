This input method allows one to type Hangul syllables using a Western
keyboard and transliteration. In most cases, typing the latin alphabet
transliteration (always in lowercase) of given Korean words should be
sufficient to obtain a correct output. 

If you are Korean and/or familiar to the layout of Korean keyboards, then
this is probably not the best input method for you: try the "hangul" input
method instead.

The transliteration process requires a lookahead of a syllable or so;
the typed text and corresponding Hangul elements retained in the buffer
are displayed on the status line at the bottom of the screen. For example,
if you type "hang", the status line should display something like

hang         : ㅎㅏㄴㄱ 

If you then type a vowel, the syllable 한 ("han") will be formed, and  
the lookahead buffer will be shifted accordingly; otherwise, consonants
and non-letter characters will cause the syllable 항 ("hang") to be formed.

Syllable breaks can be forced by using any of [/], [-], or [|], in those
cases where the automatic syllable breaking gives unsatisfactory results.
Entering one of these characters causes the lookahead buffer to be flushed;
the break character is output only if the lookahead buffer was empty.
You can only enter complete valid syllables, not isolated Hangul elements.
Most usual transliterations should be accepted, and some unusual ones as
well, but be aware that ㅓ can only be obtained by typing "eo" ("o" will
yield ㅗ), and a few other similar subtleties (see below for a full list 
of accepted transliterations).

The backspace key (or control-H) removes a character from the lookahead
buffer if it is not empty, else it is passed on to the application.
Control-C, control-D and control-G empty the lookahead buffer if it is not
empty, else they are passed on to the application.
